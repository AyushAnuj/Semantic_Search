Prototype Design Pattern:

. Prototype Pattern says that cloning of an existing object instead of creating new one and can also be customized as per the requirement.

. This pattern should be followed, if the cost of creating a new object is expensive and resource intensive.

. Prototype allows us to hide the complexity of making new instances from the client.

.  Prototype patterns is required, when object creation is time consuming, and costly operation, so we create object with existing object itself.

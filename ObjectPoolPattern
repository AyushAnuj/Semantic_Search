. Object Pool Pattern says that " to reuse the object that are expensive to create".

. An Object pool is a container which contains a specified amount of objects. When an object is taken from the pool, it is not available in the pool until it is put back.

. Objects in the pool have a lifecycle: creation, validation and destroy.
. When there are several clients who need the same resource at different times.

. Examples:
	. data source pools.
	. Thread pools.

. Advantage:
